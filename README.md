# BR_EMMD

### Autoencoder
This is used to compress the hyper-dimensional molecular features of the Bacteriorhodopsin (BR) fragment into a 2D latent space. We use this as an efficient representation of the optimal low dimensional collective variable (CV) space for our system. 

### Geometry Optimized Local Direction (GOLD) search
A geometry optimization based tool is developed to search for the minimum free energy path present between two minima within the free energy landscape of the system.

### GAT_model
An attention based graph neural network used to learn the relationship between the topological features of membrane leaflets and different structures of the embedded protein.
